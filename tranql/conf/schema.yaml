  The Translator schema aggregates reasoner schemas. Reasoner schemas
  describe transitions between biolink-model types. These transitions are
  expressed as predicates, also from the biolink-model. 
schema:
  robokop :
    doc: |
      The Robokop reasoner provides an endpoint returning the transitions it supports.

  icees :
    doc: |
      We point at the ICEES clinical reasoners schema endpoint, mapping questions it is
      capable of answering. For backplane URLs, the protocol, host, and port are implicit.
      The ICEES schema endpoint requires additional formatting and handling which we take care
      of in the backplane wrapper.

    schema: /clincial/icees/schema
  implicit_conversion:
    doc: |
      Implicit conversions bridge segments of a query. If one reasoner can return a drug exposure
      and another can take a chemical substance, implicit conversion provides a bridge between these
      types allowing the implementation of complex queries.
